FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.kleine_geistliche_konzerte.op09n08swv313_Bone_Jesu,_verbum_Patris
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 6, '3/4', 'vii%7/VII') ms3.Parse.kleine_geistliche_konzerte.op09n08swv313_Bone_Jesu,_verbum_Patris
	The label 'vii%7/VII' in m. 6, onset 3/4 (MC 6, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of a.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#6', '1', '3', '5') [('F#', 'A', 'C', 'E')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.

	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
