FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.kleine_geistliche_konzerte.op08n03swv284_Ich_danke_dem_Herrn_von_ganzem_Herzen
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 14, '1/2', 'bVI') ms3.Parse.kleine_geistliche_konzerte.op08n03swv284_Ich_danke_dem_Herrn_von_ganzem_Herzen
	The label 'bVI' in m. 14, onset 1/2 (MC 14, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of g.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('b6', 'b1', 'b3') [('Ebb', 'Gb', 'Bbb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 5 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
