============================================================

FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.kleine_geistliche_konzerte.op08n09swv290_Wohl_dem,_der_nicht_wandelt_im_Rat_der_Gottlosen
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 121, '1/2', 'V/ii') ms3.Parse.kleine_geistliche_konzerte.op08n09swv290_Wohl_dem,_der_nicht_wandelt_im_Rat_der_Gottlosen
	The label 'V/ii' in m. 121, onset 1/2 (MC 121, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of g.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#6', '#1', '#3') [('E', 'G#', 'B')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 3 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
